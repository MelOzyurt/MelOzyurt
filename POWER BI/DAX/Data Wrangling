## 1. Man Age Group Analysis

Details about how I grouped manâ€™s age at marriage using DAX:

```DAX
AgeGroupAtMarriage_Man = 
IF(
    divorce[AgeAtMarriage_Man] >= 20 && divorce[AgeAtMarriage_Man] <= 30, "20-30",
    IF(
        divorce[AgeAtMarriage_Man] >= 31 && divorce[AgeAtMarriage_Man] <= 40, "31-40",
        IF(
            divorce[AgeAtMarriage_Man] >= 41 && divorce[AgeAtMarriage_Man] <= 50, "41-50",
            IF(
                divorce[AgeAtMarriage_Man] >= 51 && divorce[AgeAtMarriage_Man] <= 60, "51-60",
                "60+"
            )
        )
    )
)
